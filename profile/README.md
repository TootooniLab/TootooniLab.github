# Meet the Lab!

## 1. Samie Mohammad Tootooni:
### Assistant Professor

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Informatics and Data Science with a secondary appointment in the Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research at Loyola University Chicago. I received my PhD in Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) from Binghamton University in 2016. Prior to joining Loyola, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Health Sciences Research at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for two years.

My research lies in the intersection of decision science and artificial intelligence, which furthers knowledge of monitoring of and predictive analytics for complex healthcare systems. I am particularly interested in the role of data science and Artificial Intelligence tools such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in development of clinical decision support models. Having an industrial and Systems Engineering background, I am also interested to apply systems thinking, quality assurance, and optimization principles to improve health outcomes. Furthermore, I teach courses such as ontologies (knowledge representation) in health and Natural Language Processing.


## 2. Nafiseh Mollaei:
### Postdoctoral Research Associate

 My research focuses on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to prevent adverse health outcomes. I’m using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform the field by extracting valuable insights from unstructured data, such as Electronic Health Records. By identifying crucial data points for population health management and clinical trials, I propose that LLMs can be helpful to facilitate the development of therapeutic Inertia.

## 3. Michael Saban:
### Graduate Student Intern

I am currently working on a project that analyzes the contributing factors of therapeutic inertia within elderly hypertensive patients. My specific role involves linking geospatial determinants of health to patient addresses at census boundary levels. This, along with further contextual information from other aspects of the project will provide insight into whether the geospatial features of the location in which a patient resides has any influence on the occurrence of therapeutic inertia.

## 4. Grant Hiura: 
### Medical Student Intern

 I am a Medical Student at Loyola University’s Stitch School of Medicine and my current project focuses on EMS-ED-Stroke. Life-saving treatments for strokes are time-sensitive and require rapid triage and transport to the appropriate stroke system of care. Prehospital data, recorded by Emergency Medical Services (EMS), can be used to develop early diagnosis tools, often using artificial intelligence (AI). By improving the quality and quantity of prehospital EMS data and ensuring its interoperability with Emergency Department (ED) data, AI-based clinical tools can be made more accurate, leading to earlier diagnosis of time-sensitive conditions such as stroke. Thus, I am excited for this project because we aim to characterize the availability and distributions of prehospital data, then examine the reliability of prehospital data by comparing EMS measurements with those acquired upon ED arrival.

Hello everyone! I am an Undergraduate Student majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Lincoln University,Pa, and I’m currently working on this advanced development platform, GitHub, for Dr.Tootooni's Lab, analyzing the uses and benefits that it can provide in an academic lab. Also, to determine how much more efficient it would make academic research. This project will be focused on the key features—Issues, Wiki and Branches, examining their uses and benefits in an academic lab. Though I am currently working on thiis project, I also have to opportunity to learn about everyone's research in the lab.....

Hi everyone! I’m Shawn Liu, a rising second year undergraduate student at Loyola University’s Lakeshore campus.  I am currently working on the creation, organization, and management of the Tootooni lab website, using both GitHub and Terminal Four. I will also be assisting Grant Hiura on another project regarding stroke hospitals, by taking each data set and sorting each of the given hospitals into what type of stroke facility they are.

## 7. Neelam Balasubramanian 
### Data Analyst

My  project seeks to extract concepts from Emergency Department (ED) Chief Complaints (CC) and map them to a structured list of CC Groups created by ED clinicians. When patients come to the ED, the CC is a short description of their reason for visit and is part of the earliest information collected for the encounter. We will first use three natural language processing (NLP) models to extract the concepts in the form of SNOMED-CT codes called SCTIDs. SNOMED-CT is a comprehensive and hierarchical clinical ontology. The three NLP models are cTAKES, cNAE, and a BERT-based model. We will also create the mappings of SCTIDs to CC groups in an SCTID Bank that takes advantage of the SNOMED-CT hierarchy to reduce manual work. Finally we will map the free text CC to the CC groups. These CC groups can be used on their own or be used in downstream processes such as resource allocation and clinical decision support.


## 8. Sushritha Konda
### Graduate Student

I am Sushritha Konda, a graduate student in health informatics program at Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis (IUPUI). Being a passionate and diligent student, I have published an article from my academic project in national as well as international journals during my under graduation and actively participated in data analysis using programming languages during my graduation. Presently, I am working as an intern for a project conducted by Prof. Mohammad Samie Tootooni in the department of health informatics and Data science where his research is focused on analyzing the quality of antibiotic dosing among the ICU patients using MIMIC and eICU datasets. I shall contribute my theoretical knowledge that I have gained from my coursework by performing appropriate data analysis, literature review, and explore the usage of Artificial Intelligence in developing the decision support tools.
